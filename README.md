# Machine Learning Project
## Stock Market Predictor
### Key Points :-
   - The project has been made in summer 2016
   - four students of IIT Kanpur under the guidance of programming club did it
   - the project was aimed at learning the algorithms of machine learning.

Website of our project is :- http://mlcoderss.github.io/ML-project/

The project has been coded in [Torch].

## Summary of the Project
Our project aims to calculate the closing value of that day of a stock in stock market. It takes opening , high , low and  total volume of the day as an input to predict the desired ouput. It has implemented basic algorithms of machine learning.

   - accuracy achieved = 65% approx. in 150 epochs
   - It also shows the error variation on graph
   - u can also save the graph and the model parameters.

#### Our aim of the project can be summarised as:-

>We are a group of four people who learned machine learning from various sites and courses.
> Finally our team was ready to make a project different from everbody,
> so we finally ended to this project.

We also thanks to coordinators of the Programming club, without them we would have not been able to do any thing. Now we also include our helpful sites and courses
we learned from:-
  * Respected [Andrew NG Sir] and his course on [Coursera]
  * Book for [neural networks] written by [Michael Nelson]
  * Python from http://learnpython.org/
  * Git from https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1
  * Torch from https://github.com/torch/torch7/wiki/Cheatsheet
  * Lua from http://tylerneylon.com/a/learn-lua/
  * Machine learning In Torch from [rnduja blog]

## **Description of the Project**
We here will describe how our code works. Our main code can be found [here].
Our data set has been imported from [Historical Stock Data].
